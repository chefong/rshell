# rshell

rshell is a command shell emulator written in C++.
The user is able to execute a single command and multiple commands (conditionally) using,
* ;
* &&
* ||

**;** means the next command is always executed. **&&** means the next command is executed ONLY IF the previous command succeeds. **||** means the next command is executed ONLY IF the previous command fails.

A single command would be:
```
ls -a
```

Multiple commands would be:
```
ls -a; echo hello world && rm hello.h
```

To run rshell, execute the following command:
```
./bin/rshell
```
