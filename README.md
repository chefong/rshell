rshell is a command shell emulator written in C++.
The user is able to execute single and multiple commands. The connectors ';', '&&', and '||' are used to conditionally execute more than one command.

A single command would be:
```
ls -a
```

Multiple commands would be:
```
ls -a; echo hello world && rm hello.h
```

To run rshell, execute the following command:
```
./bin/rshell
```
